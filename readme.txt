   Future Plans: Password Analysis

       This program’s purpose is to determine the strength passwords by comparing them to a list of ten thousand hacked passwords. A very common site for checking if your password has been compromised is haveibeenpwned.com and they published a long list of the top compromised passwords. This list was the basis of my password analyzer. After designing a point system designed to have 10 or higher be a passing grade with a maximum of 13 possible points. The overwhelming majority of the passwords scored under the ‘10’ with 10 being in the 99.995 percentile.
       This program could be modified to be called from the command line and take command-line arguments with some amount of effort and I think this would make it more useful in data processing as scripts could call it much easier. The program could be given many more options this way too. One such as changing the number of displayed passwords in the terminal because it only shows the first password of the password file. The password file could be an argument to continue to promote usability.  More so, I want the password grader even more strict. This would mostly involve steep negative grade impacts for very common names, number sets, and ending your password with 1, 2, or 3 numbers. I think this little project could definitely get continued.
